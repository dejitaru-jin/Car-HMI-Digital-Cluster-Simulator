# Car HMI Emulator - Design Document

## 1. Overview

The Car HMI Emulator is a simulation system that replicates a modern vehicle dashboard interface. It provides a platform for testing, demonstration, and development of automotive Human-Machine Interface (HMI) components without requiring access to actual vehicle hardware.

### 1.1 Purpose

This emulator serves the following purposes:
- Provide a visual representation of vehicle dashboard components
- Simulate realistic vehicle data patterns
- Allow for testing of UI components with simulated data
- Enable development and experimentation of dashboard layouts and features
- Serve as a learning tool for automotive HMI design

### 1.2 Scope

The emulator includes:
- Core instrument cluster gauges (RPM, speed, fuel level)
- Informational widgets (clock, media player, notification messages)
- Realistic data emulation for all components
- Configurable layout and component placement
- Socket-based communication between data sources and visual components

## 2. Architecture

The system uses a client-server architecture where each dashboard component (client) connects to a corresponding data emulator (server). This design enables:
- Independent data generation for each component
- Realistic simulation of vehicle data patterns
- Potential future integration with real vehicle data sources

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The application consists of three main layers:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Visual components rendered using Pygame
2. **Communication Layer**: Socket-based data transfer between components
3. **Data Layer**: Emulators that generate realistic vehicle data

### 2.2 Component Architecture

Each visual component follows a common structure:
- Inherits from a base Component class
- Connects to a data source via socket
- Updates its state based on received data
- Renders itself using Pygame primitives

Each data emulator follows a common structure:
- Inherits from a base DataEmulatorBase class
- Runs in a separate thread
- Generates realistic data patterns based on configurable behaviors
- Sends data via socket to connected components

## 3. Component Design

## 4. Data Emulation

Each component has a corresponding emulator that generates realistic data patterns:

### 4.1 RPM Emulator
- Simulates engine RPM behavior
- Models idle, acceleration, cruising, and deceleration states
- Realistic transitions between states

### 4.2 Speed Emulator
- Simulates vehicle speed behavior
- Models stopped, accelerating, cruising, decelerating, and braking states
- Smooth transitions and realistic physics

### 4.3 Fuel Emulator
- Simulates fuel level changes
- Gradual consumption with random variations
- Refill events

### 4.4 Clock Emulator
- Provides real-time clock data
- Supports various time and date formats

### 4.5 Media Emulator
- Simulates media player behavior
- Track progression and playlist management
- Playback states and controls

### 4.6 Messages Emulator
- Generates notification messages of varying priorities
- Auto-dismissal based on message type
- Realistic message generation patterns

## 5. Communication Protocol

The system uses TCP sockets for communication between components and their data sources:

- Each emulator runs a socket server on a unique port
- Components connect as clients to their respective data sources
- Data is transferred as text (plain values or JSON)
- Connection handling includes automatic reconnection

Port assignments:
- RPM Emulator: 5001
- Speed Emulator: 5002
- Fuel Emulator: 5003
- Clock Emulator: 5004
- Media Emulator: 5005
- Messages Emulator: 5006
